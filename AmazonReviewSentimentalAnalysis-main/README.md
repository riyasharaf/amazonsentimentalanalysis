Overview of Sentiment Analysis:

Sentiment Analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a subfield of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that focuses on identifying and extracting subjective information from text data. It involves determining the sentiment or emotional tone behind a body of text, such as positive, negative, or neutral. This technique is crucial in understanding consumer feedback, social media trends, and overall public opinion on various topics. The process generally includes text pre-processing, tokenization, and the application of machine learning or rule-based algorithms to classify sentiments.
